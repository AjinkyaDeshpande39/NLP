# NLP
Natural Language Processing
Attempts are made to create a character level rnn model.

There is CharLevelRNN created from scratch with help of pytorch

CharLevelRNN with RNN using pytorch

CharLevelRNN with LSTM using pytorch

CharLevelRNN with GRU using pytorch

Task - Fake email generation

results showed that model built with LSTM, model was able to spell @gmail.com , @yahoo.com (long suffixes)... where as with RNN, model could create emails with suffix like @me.in

There are also saved models for each model in .pth files..
